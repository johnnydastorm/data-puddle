Metagov Interoperable Deliberative Tools Data puddle

Hey Everyone! Here is a shared repository to make it as simple as possible to interoperate between our tools. For now - that means just sharing our flat flies, and being able to generally sort through what might be included in each different tool. Eventually we might be able to use this as a launching off spot for more generalizable collaboration or shared vocabulary! 

This repository is still in progress. Let's see what we can do with it!
